      <h3>Importance of smoke detector</h3>
      <p>A smoke detector is a device that sense smoke, typically as an indicator of a fire.
       Commercial security devices issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as a part of
       a fire alarm system.  
        Smoke detectors are housed in plastic containers , smoke detectors are typically shaped like a disk or
        square about 150 millimeters (6 in) in diameter and 25millimeters (1 in) thick, but
        shape and size vary. </p>

      <h3>Traditional Smoke Detector</h3>
      <p>Traditional smoke detectors also known as Ionisation smoke detector mainly consists of a detector chamber and a small
       amount of radioactive element. Such a radioactive material will emit radiation consisted of alpha particles when the alpha particles are produced, 
        they will collide with the air particles inside the ionization chamber. Thus causing air particles to be ionized which leads to formation of small amount 
        electric current in the chamber. And when the smoke enters the chamber electron flow is interrupted hence the alarm is sounded. When the smoke is 
        cleared and electron flow resumes the alarm stops sounding. </p>

      <h3>IOT Smoke Detector</h3>
      <p>An IoT based fire alarming system can detect fire as well as providing the location where the fire occurred When a fire occurred, the system will send a
       message. Once confirmed by the user, whether it is fire or not further action can be taken.</p>
